                    The annual HGSRC Junior Squash Tournament launched 2014 in style.  The most successful tournament to date saw 40 of our juniors playing in over 100 matches.<br /><br />
                    The tournament was split into 4 categories:- Boys Singles (Under 19), Girls Singles (Under 19), Under 15 (Mixed) and Under 11 (Mixed).<br /><br />
                    The quality of play and standard of sportsmanship shown set a great example to the large gallery present over the weekend.<br /><br />
                    The four Finals were held on the Sunday afternoon with the gladiators entering the arena to their personally selected anthem.  
                    The bar was raised for each final culminating in the Boys Singles Final where Phil Beukes selected Flash for this understated entry to the arena. Ed Walker strode into the arena to the thumping Welcome to the Jungle.<br /><br />
                    The Under 11 competition was run on a round robin basis. Bertie Carr (last year’s runner up) and Konrad Pompe advanced to the final, with Thomas Cawley coming a close 3rd.<br /><br />
                    In the Final, Bertie Carr produced a commanding performance to beat a spirited Konrad (our youngest ever finalist) 3-0.<br /><br />
                    There was a record entry for the Under 15’s. William Smith was defending his title and progressed to the final to face Sunil Popat. Sunil played extremely well to get to the Final, beating  Jacob Pompe in the Semi-Final.  Jasper Kettle took 3rd place after beating Jacob in the 3rd/4th place match.<br /><br />
                    In the Final, William played an exceptional game producing some magical shots to beat Sunil 3-0.<br /><br />
                    The Girls Singles was split into two groups this year. The group winners were Rebecca Meyrick (last year’s winner) and Sarah Jackson. Sarah had a titanic battle with Rachel Albin coming from 2-0 down to win 3-2. In the final Sarah took a 2-0 lead but Rebecca was determined to hold onto her title and fought back strongly to win 3-2 and retain the title, in a classic match.<br /><br />
                    The Boys Singles final was an explosive affair between Phil Beukes (last year’s winner) and Ed Walker.  Exquisite shot making from both players provided an enthralling encounter and Ed Walker proved the stronger competitor taking the match 3-0.<br /><br />
                    A massive thank you to all involved in making the tournament such a success!
