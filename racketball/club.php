                The history of Racketball at HGRSC is a brief one; we are still working to get more members involved in it as well as bringing in new members to take it up. In October 2011 there was no racketball being played at Holmer Green. In fact it was only in December 2011 when a few of the Lady member embarked on the 5 for £5 campaign which was supported by ESR.<br /><br />
                It was at this time that a racketball evening was started every Thursday evening using 2 courts. This was and remains an open evening for members and non-members (although non-members are encouraged to join eventually) at the cost of £3 per evening.<br /><br />
                The leagues commenced January 2012, and are currently played on a 2 month basis, and have grown to 3. The hope being that this will rise with the campaign in to encourage further membership in September 2012.<br /><br />
                What are our plans for going forward? We hope to enter a team into the region next March (2013) in line with the start of the next season. This is to be off the back of introducing Coaching, holding Exhibition Games and starting competitions.<br /><br />
