                The HGSRC was formed during the early days of the HGSA and started with 2 courts. During the seventies and eighties, the game grew enormously in popularity and the section flourished; a third court, with a glass front wall was added in the mid-eighties to meet the demand.<br /><br />
                Today these 3 pleasant and well-maintained courts are readily available for hire by members at most times. Our court charges are the most competitive in South Bucks. The club is a registered member of the England Squash & Racketball (ESR).
